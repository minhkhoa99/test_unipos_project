React Redux Context
=========================

Context Based React bindings for [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux).

## Installation

React Redux Context requires **React 16.3 or later.**

```
npm install --save react-redux-context
```

This assumes that you’re using [npm](http://npmjs.com/) package manager with a module bundler like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) to consume [CommonJS modules](http://webpack.github.io/docs/commonjs.html).

If you don’t yet use [npm](http://npmjs.com/) or a modern module bundler, and would rather prefer a single-file [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) build that makes `ReactReduxContext` available as a global object, you can grab a pre-built version from [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/react-redux). We *don’t* recommend this approach for any serious application, as most of the libraries complementary to Redux are only available on [npm](http://npmjs.com/).

## React Native

As of React Native 0.18, React Redux 5.x should work with React Native. If you have any issues with React Redux 5.x on React Native, run `npm ls react` and make sure you don’t have a duplicate React installation in your `node_modules`. We recommend that you use `npm@3.x` which is better at avoiding these kinds of issues.

If you are on an older version of React Native, you’ll need to keep using [React Redux 3.x branch and documentation](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/tree/v3.1.0) because of [this problem](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/2985).
